            <p>
              I am Jibril Richter, an aspiring software engineer. My journey to
              software engineering has been interesting. I had my education in
              Political Science and Data Science, bachelor's and master's
              degrees, respectively. However, I took a Database and Data
              Management course during my master's program where we built a web
              app for the course, and I realized this is my "thing!".
            </p>
            <p>
              Right after graduating, I interned at the Eastern Illinois
              University web development office, where I learned frontend
              technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used them to
              build different games for fun. Also, I got experience building
              Restful API architecture with Java and Spring Framwork.
            </p>

            <p>
              Before diving into software development, I worked as a Research
              Scientist at the Center for Strategic and Defense Studies, Africa,
              where I honed my skills in hypothesis development, data
              collection, and analysis with Python libraries such as Pandas,
              Numpy, and Seaborn. I dealt with both quantitative and qualitative
              research concerning various social and political problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have experience collaborating with diverse teams across local
              and international projects, which has enhanced my written and
              verbal communication skills, problem-solving skills, and team
              player skills. I am a continuous learner and adapt to new
              environments. I am confident in my skills and convinced that I
              could be a valuable team member. I would be happy to discuss any
              software development roles.
