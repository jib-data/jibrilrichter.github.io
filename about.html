                    My name is Jibril Richter, and I enjoy Web Development. My journey to web development is a long story but here is the short version. I had my bachelor’s degree in Political Science. After, I got the opportunity to work as a Research Assistant at the Center for Strategic and Defence Studies, Africa. I rose through the ranks as a Research Scientist, and then a Research Manager. I picked up mySQL and Python as the were major tools I used for statistical analysis for research purposes. I worked with both local and international teams towards numerous goals of the Center.

                    I decided to pursue master’s in Political Science at Eastern Illinois University. While doing the program, I got interested in Data Science as I worked with data at work. So I enrolled in an MSc Data Science with East London University.

                    However, as I write and practice programming for machine learning purposes, I realised I like using programming to build stuff more than to predict. I think it’s probably because I see something being created out of nothing with lines of code- it gets me giddy!

                    I chose Web Development because my close friend is a web developer, which of course made my web development journey interesting. Web Development brings both creativity and logic out of me. I get to explore the limits of my faculties.

                    When I am not coding or thinking about code, I like to play competitive sports like table tennis, long tennis and soccer.
